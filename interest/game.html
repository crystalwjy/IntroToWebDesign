				League of Legends, commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. 
				<br>
				Three lanes exist in League of Legends. These three lanes are where most of the action will take place in League of Legends.<br> You'll be fighting enemy champions, engaging in team fights, and doing as much damage as possible. The only one who isn't constantly in a lane is the jungler, or the support.

				I want to introduce my favorite support champion, Lulu, for the last part.<br>The yordle mage Lulu is known for conjuring dreamlike illusions and fanciful creatures as she roams Runeterra with her fairy companion Pix. Lulu shapes reality on a whim, warping the fabric of the world, and what she views as the constraints of this mundane, physical realm. While others might consider her magic at best unnatural, and at worst dangerous, she believes everyone could use a touch of enchantment.
